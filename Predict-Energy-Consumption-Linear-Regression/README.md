# Energy Consumption Prediction using Linear Regression

## Overview
This project implements **Linear Regression** to predict energy consumption based on various features. Two versions of the model are implemented:
- **From Scratch Implementation** by creating Gradient Descent and Cost Functions from scratch
- **Scikit-Learn Implementation** using Scikit-Learn model Linear Regression

## Dataset
The dataset is sourced from **Kaggle**, containing features such as:
- Square Footage
- Number of Occupants
- Appliances Used
- Average Temperature
- Building Type
- Day of Week

**Target Variable:** `Energy Consumption`

## Results & Comparison
### Scikit-Learn vs. From-Scratch Performance


Both implementations yield similar **high accuracy**.

## Visualization
Below is a **comparison of actual vs predicted energy consumption**:
